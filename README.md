# Docked Steamdeck Input Disabler
A [decky-loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) plugin that let you disable the steamdeck input when a bluetooth controller is connected. This is usefull when playing couch-coop games because sometimes the controllers order get mixed up and the game tries to use the steamdeck instead of the bluetooth controller. Same with emulators its so annoying when you have to reconfigure your controllers when playing docked, because your bluetooth controller is detected as player 2.

## Usage
Its really simple you only have one toggle button. When activated, the steamdeck controls will stop being detected as soon as a bluetooth controller is connected, and will be reconnected a few seconds after disconnecting all bluetooth controllers.
